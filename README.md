# Azure VMware Solution Gen2 (AVS Gen2)

Azure VMware Solution Gen2 represents the next evolution of Azure's VMware-based cloud platform, delivering enhanced capabilities, improved performance, and simplified deployment options that distinguish it from the original Gen1 implementation.

## Key Features and Improvements

### üöÄ AV64 SKU - Simplified Cluster Deployment

**Major Enhancement**: AVS Gen2 introduces the **AV64 SKU** that eliminates the traditional AV36(p) node prerequisites required in Gen1 deployments.

#### What's New:
- **Direct AV64 Deployment**: Deploy clusters directly with AV64 nodes without requiring initial AV36(p) nodes
- **Simplified Architecture**: No need for complex node migration or upgrade paths
- **Cost Optimization**: Start with the right-sized infrastructure from day one
- **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminates the multi-step deployment process required in Gen1

#### Benefits:
- **Faster Time to Production**: Reduce deployment time by eliminating prerequisite node requirements
- **Simplified Operations**: Streamlined cluster management without node type dependencies
- **Better Resource Utilization**: Deploy exactly what you need without intermediate node configurations
- **Enhanced Scalability**: Direct scaling with AV64 nodes for optimal performance

### üåê Azure Virtual Network Integration

**Game-Changing Feature**: Native integration with Azure virtual networks provides seamless connectivity and enhanced security.

#### Enhanced Connectivity:
- **Native VNet Integration**: Direct integration with Azure virtual networks without complex gateway configurations
- **Simplified Networking**: Reduced network complexity with native Azure networking constructs
- **Enhanced Security**: Leverage Azure network security groups, firewalls, and routing directly
- **Improved Performance**: Optimized network paths between AVS and Azure services

#### Key Capabilities:
- **Direct VNet Connectivity**: Connect AVS workloads directly to Azure VNets
- **Integrated Routing**: Simplified routing between on-premises, AVS, and Azure resources
- **Security Policy Inheritance**: Apply Azure network security policies consistently
- **Service Endpoint Support**: Direct access to Azure PaaS services with service endpoints

## Gen1 vs Gen2 Comparison

| Feature | Gen1 | Gen2 |
|---------|------|------|
| **Initial Cluster Deployment** | Requires AV36(p) nodes first | Direct AV64 deployment supported |
| **Network Integration** | Gateway-based connectivity | Native Azure VNet integration |
| **Deployment Complexity** | Multi-step node provisioning | Simplified single-step deployment |
| **Scaling Options** | Limited by initial node requirements | Flexible scaling with AV64 nodes |
| **Network Security** | External security appliances | Native Azure security integration |
| **Performance** | Additional network hops | Optimized direct connectivity |
